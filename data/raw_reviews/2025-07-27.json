If I have it running in the background and go back to it, if I click the \"cart\" button, it will take me to the home screen. I usually click the button 3-4x, trying to see if the \"cart\" page appears. Lately, it doesn't and I have to close the app and re-open it. Today, I had to force close it. The glitch happens multiple times a week. Also, I wish that Prime members didn't have to pay for Amazon Fresh membership.",

Change item size/color, SLOW! Too many reviews are NOT for listed product! Too much JUNK has 4+ stars! It's SLOW. search filter price range slider is gone 🤦‍♂️ Needs unit price filter & sort, please. Needs a DARK theme! Fix these & I'd give it 5 stars! old version: Even the help desk is improving, 👍Buy Now NEVER buys extended warranty!",
