If I have it running in the background and go back to it, if I click the \"cart\" button, it will take me to the home screen. I usually click the button 3-4x, trying to see if the \"cart\" page appears. Lately, it doesn't and I have to close the app and re-open it. Today, I had to force close it. The glitch happens multiple times a week. Also, I wish that Prime members didn't have to pay for Amazon Fresh membership.",
